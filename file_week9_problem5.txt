The Department of Computer Science, AMU is one of the oldest and pioneer departments of Computer Science and Information Technology in India. The Department is one of the growing departments of computer science in India, which has been witnessed by various reputed ranking agencies such as Times Higher, India today, NIRF etc.
It came into the existence in the year 1971 with the installation of IBM1130 Computing System, under the umbrella of Computer Centre and later blossomed into an independent department known as "Department of Computer Science" in the year 1988.

The approval of two new programmes, a three year Master of Computer Science and Applications (MCA) and one year Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Science Applications (PGDCA) by the standing committee of the UGC in the year 1982 and the formal introduction of these courses from the session 1983-84, were one of the major landmarks in the development of Computer Science department.
